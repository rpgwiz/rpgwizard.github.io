## Programmable
> Unlike many other popular RPG engines, RPGWizard is focused on code, providing
> you with the means to create truly unique games.

* **Customize:** Every event in RPGWizard is written in JavaScript, giving you the
ability to customize them as much as you want. It doesn't force you into using
only a small number of built-in events!

* **JavaScript:** As RPGWizard uses standard JavaScript, one of the
[most popular programming languages](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology){:target="_blank"}
in the world you, are able to leverage a massive amount of resources. Everything
from libraries, tutorials, books, IDEs, and more.

## Game Editor
> Even with its strong emphasis on coding, RPGWizard still comes with a visual
> editor for creating and organizing game assets common to most RPG games.

* **Assets:** Numerous asset editors are included covering everything from maps,
characters, enemies, animations, etc. making it easy to quickly build up your
game's world.

* **Built-in Events:** There is an ever growing list of built-in events being
added to the editor to cover the most common use cases.

* **Windows & Linux:** RPGWizard offers the same unified experience across both
Windows and Linux without having to worry about platform specifics.
