# About
RPGWizard is an open-source 2D game creation tool that specialises in making RPGs. It comes with a graphical editor and browser based game engine, both of which are completely free-to-use.

## History
RPGWizard owes its heritage to another now inactive RPG creation tool, the RPGToolkit, from which RPGWizard was originally forked. The fork started on **May 21, 2017**, and some of the original codebase contains what was meant to be RPGToolkit 4.x. However due to creative differences between the lead developers, **swordmaster** (Joshua Michael Daly), split from RPGToolkit to start RPGWizard.

## Goal of RPGWizard
The goal of the RPGWizard is to fill the niche that exists between [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) (What You See Is What You Get) RPG creation tools, and writing everything yourself from scratch. Today RPG creators are faced with choosing tools that either offer ease-of-use but no flexibility, or having total flexibility with mountains of code to write themselves.

RPGWizard aims to sit in-between these 2 extremes by providing both a complete editor environment with defined file types, and a mature programming interface with plenty of examples. This will give the user the option to customise their games with code while still providing a level of WYSIWYG editing.
