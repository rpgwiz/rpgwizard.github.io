# How we process your Data
This website is powered by Jekyll, and GitHub. Github, (like any hosting company)
can have full insight into visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited
pages, etc. Note that Github is not known to actively profile visitors.
By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.

## GitHub Comments
If you wish to see GitHub comments on the various pages throughout this site,
most notably the News section, then you'll need to accept our cookies. We use
cookies to store the most recent comments in your browser to stay within the
limits of GitHub's API requests. However this is completely optional, and
you can just navigate straight to the Issue in GitHub to view and post comments.
